# This will read the dune.module file for project information and
# set the following variables:
#
#	project                     From the Module: field
#	${project}_NAME             Same as above
#	${project}_DESCRIPTION      From the Description: field
#	${project}_VERSION_MAJOR    From the Version: field
#	${project}_VERSION_MINOR    From the Version: field also
#
# This module should be the first to be included in the project,
# because most of the others (OpmXxx.cmake) use these variables.

# for CMake >= 3.0, we need to change a few policies:
#
#   - CMP0026 to allow access to the LOCATION target property
#   - CMP0048 to indicate that we want to deal with the *VERSION*
#     variables ourselves
#   - CMP0064 to indicate that we want TEST if conditions to be evaluated
#   - CMP0074 to indicate that <PackageName>_ROOT can be used to find package
#             config files
