.SH DESCRIPTION
co2brinepvt computes PVT PROPERTY of a brine/co2 system. The
computation is performed for a given PHASE (oil or brine), PRESSURE
(in bar), TEMPERATURE (in Celsius),  SALINITY (salt molality in
mol/kg) and RS (amount of dissolved CO2 in Brine in SM3/SM3), RV
(amount of vaporized water in Gas in SM3/SM3), salt model
(SALTMODEL), model of thermal mixing of gas, liquid, amd salt
(THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_GAS ans THERMAL_MIXING_MODEL_LIQUID, 
respectively).
