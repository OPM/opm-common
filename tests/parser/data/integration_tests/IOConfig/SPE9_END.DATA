OIL
GAS
WATER
DISGAS
-- As seen from figure 4 in Odeh, GOR is increasing with time,
-- which means that dissolved gas is present

DX
-- There are in total 300 cells with length 1000ft in x-direction
   	300*1000 /
DY
-- There are in total 300 cells with length 1000ft in y-direction
	300*1000 /
DZ
-- The layers are 20, 30 and 50 ft thick, in each layer there are 100 cells
	100*20 100*30 100*50 /

TOPS
-- The depth of the top of each grid block
	100*8325 /

PORO
-- Constant porosity of 0.3 throughout all 300 grid cells
   	300*0.3 /

PERMX
-- The layers have perm. 500mD, 50mD and 200mD, respectively.
	100*500 100*50 100*200 /

PERMY
-- Equal to PERMX
	100*500 100*50 100*200 /

PERMZ
-- Cannot find perm. in z-direction in Odeh's paper
-- For the time being, we will assume PERMZ equal to PERMX and PERMY:
