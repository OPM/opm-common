These ML modules are heavily modifiying and extending the previous work done in Kerasify by Maevskikh and Rose. Kerasify is a library for running trained Keras models from a C++ platform. Our implementation is also compliant with the automatic differentiation approach used in OPM. The implementation works with Python v.3.9.0 and above (up to <=3.12.0).
