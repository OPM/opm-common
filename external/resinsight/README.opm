This directory contains a selection of files from ResInsight(https://github.com/OPM/ResInsight).
This part of the code of ResInsight is used within OPM-Flow to calculate,
given a geometric (thus grid-independent) well trajectory the I,J,K coordinates of intersected cells
and the well line segments within these cells.
