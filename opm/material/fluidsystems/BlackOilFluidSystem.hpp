// Here we need to define certain macros before including the macrotemplate file.
// 
// The idea is in essence the following:
//   1) In the macrotemplate file, we have method declarations of the form
//      
//        `STATIC_OR_DEVICE void foo();`
//      
//      and member variable declarations of the form
//
//        `STATIC_OR_NOTHING int bar;`
//
//   2) We want to be able to compile the same code for both the dynamic (non-static) and static
//      versions of the fluid system. The dynamic version is used when the fluid system is accessed
//      from the GPU, while the static version is used when the fluid system is accessed from the CPU.
//   3) We want to be able to compile the same code for both the dynamic and static versions of the
//      fluid system, but with different method and member variable declarations.
//
// Furthermore, we need to specify the class name of the fluid system, which is different for the
// nonstatic and static versions of the fluid system. We also need to specify if we are compiling
// the static version of the fluid system, since we will define certain constructors and singleton
// functions only in the static or nonstatic case. 

// Is defined for the static version of the fluid system.
#define COMPILING_STATIC_FLUID_SYSTEM

// The static version does not need any gpu decorators, simply static
#define STATIC_OR_DEVICE static

// Make sure member variables are declared as static
#define STATIC_OR_NOTHING static

// Functions defined outside of the class need OPM_HOST_DEVICE, but never static
#define NOTHING_OR_DEVICE

// Define the class names for the static and nonstatic versions of the fluid system
#define FLUIDSYSTEM_CLASSNAME_NONSTATIC BlackOilFluidSystemNonStatic
#define FLUIDSYSTEM_CLASSNAME_STATIC BlackOilFluidSystem

// Define the class name for the fluid system
#define FLUIDSYSTEM_CLASSNAME BlackOilFluidSystem


// We need to forward-declare the nonstatic version of the fluid system, since we will 
// make the nonstatic version a friend of the static version being defined here.
